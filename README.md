- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) – a course on the practical aspects of using Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and BSD. Lots of useful tips and tricks, especially for beginners

## Frontend
### React
- [useHooks](https://usehooks.com/) – a collection of server-safe React hooks from the ui.dev team. The documentation is well-done

### Next.js
I love Next and Vercel teams. The way they build products and community around them are inspiring, so I decided to have a separate section for Next.js-related resources
- [Next.js/learn](https://nextjs.org/learn) – to me, it's just a perfect example on how to build a learning platform. The content is well-structured, the UI is clean and simple. Even if you don't need to learn Next.js, it's a good place to get inspiration 
- [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) – simple and quite flexible site generation framework with optimized links and images. I mostly see it as a 'documentation/quick guide' builder, but seems to be fine for blogs and small projects
### Templates
- [Lexington Themes](https://lexingtonthemes.com/) – really good Astro/Tailwind templates made by [Michael Andreuzza](https://twitter.com/Mike_Andreuzza). 99$/template, but seems to worth it.
- [Windstatic](https://windstatic.com/) – from the Lexington creator, templates & layouts
  made with Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js. Free to use, nice to have.
### Components
- [Quilljs](https://quilljs.com/) – opensource rich text editor, I've used it in a couple of projects. Guides, documentation, and examples are also well-done
### Frameworks
- [Triggers.dev](https://trigger.dev/) – open source typescript Background Jobs. Lots of visibility, reminds me of Temporal, but more lightweight and for the frontend stack


## Design
### Insipration
- [Layers](https://layers.to/) – the first website that comes to mind when I need some inspiration for the web design.
- [Relume](https://www.relume.io/) – AI-powered website builder. I don't really use it, but their landing is a piece of art.
### Libraries 
- [UI land](https://ui.land/) – Digital Library for Designers and Engineers. Kinda a collection like mine, but for design world. They also do author interviews, like this one with [Paco](https://ui.land/interviews/paco-coursey), cool stuff to get familiar with the industry and people

### Kotlin
I love Kotlin with all my heart, and it's the main language I'm using for backend development. Lots of resources here, but I'll try to keep it short
#### Coroutines
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) – the official documentation is the best place to start. Easy to understand, and has lots of examples
#### Libraries
We're living in the world of lightweight trends, and Kotlin is one of the best languages to build such
- [Jooby](https://jooby.io/) – DSL-based web framework, similar to Ktor, but even more lightweight and easy to start with
### Java

## Machine learning
- [Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark) – opensource text-prompted Generative Audio Model, the quality is just insane

## Interpreters
- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) – a book on how to build your own programming language, literally. I've read it a couple of times and found it really useful to start understanding how our favorite languages are built. The book is free to read online

## Tools
- [Pika](https://pika.style/) – MacOS-style screenshot online modifier with API(!). Lots of customization and templates, fav to use for twitter posts
- [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) – just like Pika, but for code snippets only. Free to use, no sign in, multiple themes, mostly using for solid-color only (still much better than VSCode screenshots tho)
- [Shots](https://shots.so/) – free to use, pretty mockups. Different styles, shadows, borders, backgrounds. Similar to Pika, just a matter of taste
- [Graphy](https://visualize.graphy.app/) – a tool to create breathtaking diagrams and flowcharts. By breathtaking I mean it, the quality of the output is just amazing. Lots of inspiration for your own charts as well
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) – a whiteboard tool aka _what tool do you use to draw your diagrams?_ Hand-drawn feel, love it. I've migrated from lucid charts to this one for the sake of visual appeal, and still subscribed after a year of usage.

## Databases
Ah yes, the big world of big data. Fancy deep dive guides on SQL, NoSQL, and everything in between
- [SQL Indexing and Tuning](https://use-the-index-luke.com/) – a comprehensive guide on SQL indexing and tuning. The website is a bit outdated (as almost everything in the databases world), but the content is still relevant

### K8s
- [Keda](https://keda.sh/) – K8s-based Event Driven Autoscaling, so you can drive the scaling of any container in K8s based on the number of events needing to be processed (e.g. scale based on Kafka topic)
- [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) – a tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications. Sound like docker-compose for K8s, but there is much more under the hood
