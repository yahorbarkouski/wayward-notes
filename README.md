## Instructions / Tutorials
- [Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps) – a collection of interactive roadmaps for developers. I don't really follow it, but it's a good place to start if you're new to the industry and want to explore tech stacks
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) – a course on the practical aspects of using Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and BSD. Lots of useful tips and tricks, especially for beginners

## Frontend
### Next.js
- [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) – simple and quite flexible site generation framework with optimized links and images. I mostly see it as a 'documentation/quick guide' builder, but seems to be fine for blogs and small projects
### Templates
- [Lexington Themes](https://lexingtonthemes.com/) – really good Astro/Tailwind templates made by [Michael Andreuzza](https://twitter.com/Mike_Andreuzza). 99$/template, but seems to worth it.
- [Windstatic](https://windstatic.com/) – from the Lexington creator, templates & layouts
  made with Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js. Free to use, nice to have.
### Components
- [Quilljs](https://quilljs.com/) – opensource rich text editor, I've used it in a couple of projects. Guides, documentation, and examples are also well-done
### Frameworks
- [Triggers.dev](https://trigger.dev/) – open source typescript Background Jobs. Lots of visibility, reminds me of Temporal, but more lightweight and for the frontend stack
## Design
### Insipration
- [Layers](https://layers.to/) – the first website that comes to mind when I need some inspiration for the web design.
- [Relume](https://www.relume.io/) – AI-powered website builder. I don't really use it, but their landing is a piece of art.
### Libraries 
- [UI land](https://ui.land/) – Digital Library for Designers and Engineers. Kinda a collection like mine, but for design world. They also do author interviews, like this one with [Paco](https://ui.land/interviews/paco-coursey), cool stuff to get familiar with the industry and people

## Backend
### Testing
- [Testcontainers best practices](https://www.atomicjar.com/2023/11/testcontainers-best-practices/) – a short guide on testcontainers best practices by [Siva](https://twitter.com/sivalabs), lots of insights, ~7 min read 
### Queues and messaging
- [Kafka exactly once semantics](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2020/05/kafka-exactly-once-semantics.html) – a great article on how to _achieve_ exactly once semantics in Kafka by [Nitin](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/author/nitin-kumar), one of the best explanations I've found. ~5 min read
- [Conductor/Kafka](https://www.conduktor.io/kafka/) – lots of learning resources, including articles and videos. The website UI for a backend-related tool is just surprising, not sure if it's a good or bad thing
- [Kafka: a map of traps for the enlightened dev and op by Emmanuel Bernard And Clement Escoffier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paVdXL5vDzg&t=2s&ab_channel=Devoxx) – the best Kafka deep dive you can find on the internet. ~3h video, but worth every minute. I was so delighted to find it, even asked to provide a [slides link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yrOtC7JO6W9Eig7yY6TQT9qCu_thQN-s)
- [Idempotent consumers](https://medium.com/lydtech-consulting/kafka-idempotent-consumer-transactional-outbox-74b304815550) – short and clear explanation of idempotent consumers and transactional outbox pattern. ~5 min read
## Machine learning
- [Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark) – opensource text-prompted Generative Audio Model, the quality is just insane

## Tools
- [Pika](https://pika.style/) – MacOS-style screenshot online modifier with API(!). Lots of customization and templates, fav to use for twitter posts
- [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) – just like Pika, but for code snippets only. Free to use, no sign in, multiple themes, mostly using for solid-color only (still much better than VSCode screenshots tho)
- [Shots](https://shots.so/) – free to use, pretty mockups. Different styles, shadows, borders, backgrounds. Similar to Pika, just a matter of taste
- [Graphy](https://visualize.graphy.app/) – a tool to create breathtaking diagrams and flowcharts. By breathtaking I mean it, the quality of the output is just amazing. Lots of inspiration for your own charts as well
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) – a whiteboard tool aka _what tool do you use to draw your diagrams?_ Hand-drawn feel, love it. I've migrated from lucid charts to this one for the sake of visual appeal, and still subscribed after a year of usage.

## Infrastructure
- [Aws Skill Builder](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn) – learning center to build in-demand cloud skills. Lots of free content, including labs, courses, and quizzes. I've used it to prepare for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate exam, one of the best resources I've found

## Interviews
Collection of useful resources for technical interviews, including coding, system design, and behavioral questions.
### System Design
- [System Design Patterns](https://github.com/Sairyss/system-design-patterns) – the most handy collection of design patterns for designing scalable and maintainable systems, ~1h read
- [Architectural Notes](https://architecturenotes.co/) lovely UI, high quality diagrams, but not so many content. Still, worth subscribing to their newsletter
- [Interview Pen](https://interviewpen.com/) – high-quality video explanations on system design topics, including real-world examples and best practices. Paid for the platform, but youtube channel is great as well
### Algo practice
- [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) – a collection of 300+ coding challenges and interview questions, love the way they are organized by difficulty and type. Free platform, great solutions, medium-size community, but no completions unfortunately
- [Code Signal](https://codesignal.com/) – if you've ever been in Netflix interviews, you should be familiar with this one. Can be used in multiple ways – regular challenge practice, or mock tech screen when you have a limited time to solve a bunch of high-quality problems. 100% recommended if looking for a FAANG job


## Blogs
### Frontend
- [Not a Number](https://www.nan.fyi/) by Nanda Syahrasyad is the most beautiful blog I've ever seen, really well-done. Want to learn svg animations deep dive, motion, random javascript tricks – this is the first place to go 
- [nexxel.dev](https://nexxel.dev/) by Shoubhit Dash – typescript, rust, and some random thoughts on techcnical topics from a young CS undergrad student. I really like the way he writes and projects he's working on, some samples: [hackernews clone](https://github.com/nexxeln/hackernews), [Everything I Installed on My New Mac](https://www.nexxel.dev/blog/new-mac), [Implementing the Pipe Operator in TypeScript](https://www.nexxel.dev/blog/pipe)

## Other
- [Whereby](https://whereby.com/) – API & SDK to integrate video calls to your website. Haven't used it yet, but seems to be a first candidate for the next project with video calls
