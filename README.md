## Frontend
### Templates
- [Lexington Themes](https://lexingtonthemes.com/) – really good Astro/Tailwind templates made by [Michael Andreuzza](https://twitter.com/Mike_Andreuzza). 99$/template, but seems to worth it.
### Components
- [Quilljs](https://quilljs.com/) – opensource rich text editor, I've used it in a couple of projects. Guides, documentation, and examples are also well-done
## Design
### Libraries 
- [UI land](https://ui.land/) – Digital Library for Designers and Engineers. Kinda a collection like mine, but for design world. They also do author interviews, like this one with [Paco](https://ui.land/interviews/paco-coursey), cool stuff to get familiar with the industry and people

## Tools
- [Pika](https://pika.style/) – MacOS-style screenshot online modifier with API(!). Lots of customization and templates, fav to use for twitter posts
- [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) – just like Pika, but for code snippets only. Free to use, no sign in, multiple themes, mostly using for solid-color only (still much better than VSCode screenshots tho)
- [Graphy](https://visualize.graphy.app/) – a tool to create breathtaking diagrams and flowcharts. By breathtaking I mean it, the quality of the output is just amazing. Lots of inspiration for your own charts as well
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) – a whiteboard tool aka _what tool do you use to draw your diagrams?_ Hand-drawn feel, love it. I've migrated from lucid charts to this one for the sake of visual appeal, and still subscribed after a year of usage.

## Interviews
Collection of useful resources for technical interviews, including coding, system design, and behavioral questions.
### System Design
- [System Design Patterns](https://github.com/Sairyss/system-design-patterns) – the most handy collection of design patterns for designing scalable and maintainable systems, ~1h read
- [Architectural Notes](https://architecturenotes.co/) lovely UI, high quality diagrams, but not so many content. Still, worth subscribing to their newsletter
- [Interview Pen](https://interviewpen.com/) – high-quality video explanations on system design topics, including real-world examples and best practices. Paid for the platform, but youtube channel is great as well
### Algo practice
- [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) – a collection of 300+ coding challenges and interview questions, love the way they are organized by difficulty and type. Free platform, great solutions, medium-size community, but no completions unfortunately
- [Code Signal](https://codesignal.com/) – if you've ever been in Netflix interviews, you should be familiar with this one. Can be used in multiple ways – regular challenge practice, or mock tech screen when you have a limited time to solve a bunch of high-quality problems. 100% recommended if looking for a FAANG job


## Blogs
### Frontend
- [Not a Number](https://www.nan.fyi/) by Nanda Syahrasyad is the most beautiful blog I've ever seen, really well-done. Want to learn svg animations deep dive, motion, random javascript tricks – this is the first place to go 
- [nexxel.dev](https://nexxel.dev/) by Shoubhit Dash – typescript, rust, and some random thoughts on techcnical topics from a young CS undergrad student. I really like the way he writes and projects he's working on, some samples: [hackernews clone](https://github.com/nexxeln/hackernews), [Everything I Installed on My New Mac](https://www.nexxel.dev/blog/new-mac), [Implementing the Pipe Operator in TypeScript](https://www.nexxel.dev/blog/pipe)
